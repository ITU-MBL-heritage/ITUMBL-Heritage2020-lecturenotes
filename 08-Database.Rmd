# Databases

## Connection to POSTGIS using SSL
QGIS has an ability to connect to various different databases. Geopackage, Oracle Spatial, PostGIS, SpatiaLite.

![Databases that can be connected through QGIS](Images\databases.png)

We are going to use PostGIS in our projects.

>PostGIS is the geographic extension of the database management system, PostgreSQL, which allows us to store geographic objects as part of our data tables. A geographic object is a special type of data that allows us to store a geographic position or a set of them as part of a line or a polygon. Essentially, PostGIS is a powerful tool that enables you to handle complex geographical data and visually explore this data when you use it along with graphical tools, such as QGIS.

We will be hosting our PostGIS database using Google Cloud.To access it we need to connect using SSL. (However, the eduroam connection in the campus prevents us to use the port 5432 which is the usual postgreSQL port so we need to use out of the ITU network)

To connect you will need to download 3 certificate files. server-ca.pem, client-cert.pem, client-key.pem. Download these files and place them to a folder that is accesible.

From processing toolbox click the right most icon, **options**. 

From the menu select **Authentication**. 

![Manage Certificates](Images\ManageCertificates.png)

And next select **manage certificates**.

Here from the authorities tab, click + to add Google Cloud certificate.

![Certificate Manager](Images\certificatemanager.png)

Here from the import certificate menu, click ... icon and locate your server-ca.pem file.

![Import Certificate](Images\importcertificate.png)


Back from the certificate manager screen click to the identities tab and click + icon. 

![Import Identities](Images\importIdentity.png)

From the import identity screen, select PKI PEM/DER Certificate Paths. For cert select client-cert.pem and for key select client-key.pem.



Next, close the identity screen and from the Authentication screen click + icon. 

![Authentication window](Images\authentication.png)

From the dialogue box, select PKI stored identity certificate, and select the certificate that you have created (editor). write a name (eg. Google Cloud) and save.

Now close the windows and from the browser panel select PostGIS and right click and select new connection.

Here you need to enter information required to setup a connection to our server. Fill out the information as following:

![PostGIS information](Images\postGISinfo.png)

The username and password for our database is **editor** and **123post**. After this step we will be connected to the server.

Server connections work similar to the layers. If you have a geospatial data you can import or export to the database. 

For this project, we need to have a database of caravanserais as point geometries and we need topography information as vector layer.

## Introduction to POSTGIS

After connecting to the database, you can see our two tables iran_han and turk_han on the left side of the screen. 

![PostGIS Connection](Images\postgisConnection.png)

POSTGIS database uses SQL Structured Query Language , to create the table turk_han I used the following SQL query (Showing this for you as a reference you dont need to do this, I already created our tables.)

```{ }
CREATE TABLE turk_han  ( id serial, 
common_names character(30),  
alternative_names character(100), 
village character(30), 
district character(30), 
province character(30), 
date character(30), 
reference varchar, 
layer character(10),  
the_geom geometry,    
CONSTRAINT turk_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)  );
```

To insert a new feature/han we need to run a sql query. Below you can see an example feature.

```{ }
INSERT INTO turk_han (common_names, 
alternative_names, 
village, 
district, 
province, 
date, 
reference, 
layer, 
the_geom) 
VALUES ('Alacahan Kervansarayı', NULL, 'Alacahan', 'Kangal', 'Sivas', '1150-1180', NULL, 'VAR', ST_GeomFromEWKT('SRID=4326;POINT(37.5975095 39.1058708)'));
```


To update data you need to first find the id of the feature that you want to change. For this you can use SELECT query.

```{ }
SELECT * FROM turk_han
WHERE common_name = 'Alacahan Kervansarayı'
```
For example this query brings all the entries that has common_name as Alacahan Kervansarayı. For example, to update its location you can use the query below.

	
```{ }
UPDATE turk_han
SET the_geom = ST_GeomFromEWKT('SRID=4326;POINT(37.5975095 39.10587)')
WHERE
	id = 4;
```
