In addition to giving an overview of theories and principles in digital heritage, both in Turkey and internationally, the course gives an introduction to research methods in three areas related to cultural heritage: collection/management, visualization/communication, and analysis/ interpretation. 1.2 Aims To help students understand the link between cultural heritage and computing; to introduce key issues in digital heritage; to provide students with the basic theoretical and practical knowledge of digital methods such as GIS, AR/VR, AI. 1.3 Learning outcomes Students who take this course gain will knowledge, ability and proficiency in the following subjects: Knowledge of historical, contemporary and specialized issues in the area of visual computation through original research, Understanding of the interdisciplinarity of computation in cultural heritage, Ability to assess methods and applications of digital heritage through systematic approaches, Ability to assess and apply research methodology, Competence in creative and critical thinking, problem-solving and decision making. 1.4 Conduct The course will be conducted as seminars with weekly readings and assignments. During the course of the semester, students are required to submit written and practical assignments as requested by the instructors during class, and one final paper, based on either literature research or an original argument, and an in-class presentation of the final paper at the semester end. The essays submitted throughout the semester are to constitute the basis for the final paper; these should take into account class discussions, as well as students’ own reflections. The final paper should be around 3000 words and structured with an introduction, development, and conclusion. The grading for the course is as follows: attendance and in-class participation in discussions and weekly response papers, 30%; hands-on practices, 30%; one end-of-semester paper, 20%; final project presentation by individual/group 20%. 1.5 Project The collective efforts of the course participants will be part of a digital heritage project on Caravanserais of Anatolia. All works will be uploaded to the website. 1.6 Weekly Schedule "],

["databases.html", "Chapter 9 Databases 9.1 Connection to POSTGIS using SSL 9.2 Introduction to POSTGIS", " Chapter 9 Databases 9.1 Connection to POSTGIS using SSL QGIS has an ability to connect to various different databases. Geopackage, Oracle Spatial, PostGIS, SpatiaLite. Databases that can be connected through QGIS We are going to use PostGIS in our projects. PostGIS is the geographic extension of the database management system, PostgreSQL, which allows us to store geographic objects as part of our data tables. A geographic object is a special type of data that allows us to store a geographic position or a set of them as part of a line or a polygon. Essentially, PostGIS is a powerful tool that enables you to handle complex geographical data and visually explore this data when you use it along with graphical tools, such as QGIS. We will be hosting our PostGIS database using Google Cloud.To access it we need to connect using SSL. (However, the eduroam connection in the campus prevents us to use the port 5432 which is the usual postgreSQL port so we need to use out of the ITU network) To connect you will need to download 3 certificate files. server-ca.pem, client-cert.pem, client-key.pem. Download these files and place them to a folder that is accesible. From processing toolbox click the right most icon, options. From the menu select Authentication. Manage Certificates And next select manage certificates. Here from the authorities tab, click + to add Google Cloud certificate. Certificate Manager Here from the import certificate menu, click … icon and locate your server-ca.pem file. Import Certificate Back from the certificate manager screen click to the identities tab and click + icon. Import Identities From the import identity screen, select PKI PEM/DER Certificate Paths. For cert select client-cert.pem and for key select client-key.pem. Next, close the identity screen and from the Authentication screen click + icon. Authentication window From the dialogue box, select PKI stored identity certificate, and select the certificate that you have created (editor). write a name (eg. Google Cloud) and save. Authentication Dialogue Box Now close the windows and from the browser panel select PostGIS and right click and select new connection. PostGIS server settings Here you need to enter information required to setup a connection to our server. Fill out the information as following: PostGIS information The username and password for our database is editor and 123post. After this step we will be connected to the server. Server connections work similar to the layers. If you have a geospatial data you can import or export to the database. For this project, we need to have a database of caravanserais as point geometries and we need topography information as vector layer. 9.2 Introduction to POSTGIS After connecting to the database, you can see our two tables iran_han and turk_han on the left side of the screen. PostGIS Connection POSTGIS database uses SQL Structured Query Language , to create the table turk_han I used the following SQL query (Showing this for you as a reference you dont need to do this, I already created our tables.) CREATE TABLE turk_han ( id serial, common_names character(30), alternative_names character(100), village character(30), district character(30), province character(30), date character(30), reference varchar, layer character(10), the_geom geometry, CONSTRAINT turk_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id) ); To insert a new feature/han we need to run a sql query. Below you can see an example feature. INSERT INTO turk_han (common_names, alternative_names, village, district, province, date, reference, layer, the_geom) VALUES (&#39;Alacahan Kervansarayı&#39;, NULL, &#39;Alacahan&#39;, &#39;Kangal&#39;, &#39;Sivas&#39;, &#39;1150-1180&#39;, NULL, &#39;VAR&#39;, ST_GeomFromEWKT(&#39;SRID=4326;POINT(37.5975095 39.1058708)&#39;)); To update data you need to first find the id of the feature that you want to change. For this you can use SELECT query. SELECT * FROM turk_han WHERE common_names = &#39;Alacahan Kervansarayı&#39;; For example this query brings all the entries that has common_name as Alacahan Kervansarayı. For example, to update its location you can use the query below. UPDATE turk_han SET the_geom = ST_GeomFromEWKT(&#39;SRID=4326;POINT(37.5975095 39.10587)&#39;) WHERE id = 4; To see longitude we can run another query: SELECT common_names, ST_X(the_geom::geometry) AS longitude FROM turk_han; "],
["assignment.html", "Chapter 10 Assignment 10.1 Collecting the data &amp; Creating the layer", " Chapter 10 Assignment You have been collecting data from the written resources.The primary resources were: International database on caravanserais, OWTRAD Academic publications, ACUN, ERDMANN, ILTER, CEKUL, etc.. Websites by travelers, TURKISHHANS You have been using QGIS, Google Earth, Gsheet, Gdrive to structure the data. As our approach is rather Geotemporal, for the next step, you will be using the central database of QGIS. Next step will to explore the ACCURACY of the data: Level 1: REGISTERED HISTORICAL BUILDINGS (TESCILLI BINALAR) by Ministry of Culture and Tourism, State Museums/Sites (Müzeler ve Ören Yerleri), Local Authorities (Belediyeler): https://www.kulturportali.gov.tr/ https://muze.gov.tr/muzeler Level 2: Researched Historical Buildings by Local and Academic Authorities.

Create a GeoPackage layer. Layer&gt;Create Layer&gt;New GeoPackage Layer… Create GeoPackage Layer After creating an empty geopackage layer, we are going to create our caravanserais as points. Right click on the created layer and select Open Attribute Table. Here you can see our empty table we need to create as many fields as we require. We will at least require Name field as text and Longitude and Latitude as decimal fields. In this table to edit the layer we need to click on the Toggle Editing mode icon. Enter the fields with the collected data. Create GeoPackage Layer After creating all the features in our table we need to create the point geometries that is on the coordinates that we entered. For this, we are going to use Create points layer from table from processing toolbox.
